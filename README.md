## SyriaTel Customer Churn Prediction
### Project Overview
## 1. Business Problem
Customer retention is at the heart of every thriving Telecom company. Managing and reducing customer churn is essential for maintaining revenue, profitability, and market share. By focusing on churn reduction, telecom companies can enhance customer satisfaction, increase the lifetime value of their customers, and secure a stronger position in the competitive market. SyriaTelecommunication is well aware of the common marketplace comment that "it is cheaper to retain a converted customer than acquire a new client. As a result, I have been tasked to build a classification model that will predict whether a customer will soon stop doing business with them. 

The research at hand delves into machine learning algorithms and offers recommendations tailored to the telecommunications industry. In a competitive telecom sector where customers can effortlessly switch from one provider to another, telecom companies are understandably concerned about customer retention and devising strategies to retain their clientele. By preemptively identifying customers likely to switch providers through behavioral analysis, they can devise targeted offers and services based on historical records. 

The core objective of this study is to predict churn in advance and pinpoint the primary factors that may influence customers to migrate to other telecom providers. The project will explore various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression and decision trees to develop a robust churn prediction model. Model performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to ensure the best possible outcomes. This will provide the insight the board members need when making policies and procedures that will enable the business gear towards retaining the customers and continue being relevant in the marketplace.

See below questions the project aims to answer:
1. What is the churn current % rate.
2. What features/attributes do the customers who churn have.
3. What strategies can SyriaTel implement to increase customer retention.
